# pug-introduction

This is an example of how to use [Pug](https://github.com/pugjs/pug) with [Gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp) or [Express](https://github.com/expressjs/express), I've created it to do a lecture about it on [HTML-SP](https://www.meetup.com/html-sp/events/251440661/).

You can check the slides [here](https://speakerdeck.com/alefesouza/introduction-to-pug-template-engine) and the video [here](https://youtube.com/watch?v=t6ZkhDRluzw).
